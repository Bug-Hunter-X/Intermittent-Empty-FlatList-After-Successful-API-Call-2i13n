# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList in React Native intermittently renders an empty list even after a successful API call. The API call correctly retrieves data, but the FlatList fails to display it. This issue is not consistently reproducible, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

A FlatList component is used to display data fetched from a remote API.  While the API call is successful (verified through network inspection), the FlatList remains empty in some instances. There are no apparent error messages or warnings in the console.

## Solution

The solution involves adding more robust error handling and checking to ensure the fetched data is correctly structured and handled before rendering to the FlatList.
